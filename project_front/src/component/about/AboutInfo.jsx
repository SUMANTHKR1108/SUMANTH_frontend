              Freelancers are typically considered to be independent
              contractors. They may do their work full-time or as a side job to
              supplement full-time employment. As independent contractors,
              freelancers typically require signed contracts for the job to be
              done. They'll agree to a predetermined fee based on the time,
              skill, and effort required to complete the task. This may be a
              flat fee, a per-hour fee, a per-day fee, a per-project fee, or
              some other similar measure. Freelancers tend to work in the
              creative, skilled, or service sectors.

              Freelancers handle contract work on a part-time or full-time basis
              and often sign agreements before starting projects.With
              freelancing, the client pays per project, per task, or per hour,
              depending on the agreement. Freelance projects typically involve
              short-term assignments,although satisfied clients often request
              follow-on work. Most freelance jobs are available in the skills,
              service, and creative sectors, such as copywriting, programming,
              engineering, and marketing.
